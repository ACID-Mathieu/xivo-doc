Translating XiVO
****************

We are now using a centralized tool for the XiVO translation. It's Transifex and the web access is :

* https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/xivo

For each project we have a reference file fetched by transiflex in our git. This file is always by default in english and translated with transifex.

.. note:: For now, the Jenkins part is replaced with manual actions from developers.
