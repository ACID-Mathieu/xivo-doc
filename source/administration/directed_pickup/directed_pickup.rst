Directed Pickup
***************

Directed pickup allows a user to intercept calls made to another user.

For example, if a user with number 1001 is ringing, you can dial \*81001 from
your phone and it will intercept (i.e. pickup) the call to this user.

The extension prefix used to pickup calls can be changed via the
:menuselection:`Services --> IPBX --> IPBX services --> Extensions` page.
