*******************
Sheet Configuration
*******************

Sheets can be defined under :menuselection:`Services --> CTI Server --> Models`
in the web interface. Once a sheet is defined, it has to be assigned to an event
in the :menuselection:`Services --> CTI Server --> Events` menu.

Model
   The model is the content of the displayed sheet.
Event
   Events are action that trigger the defined sheet. A sheet can be assigned to
   many events. In that case, the sheet will be raised for each events.

In the first tab the name of your model can be configured.
When you checkbox focus is checked, your xivo client focus when you received a sheet.
The description allow the administrator to give an overview of a given sheet.

Sheets
======

This tab is dedicated for the form/information of your sheet. You can define an
external form created with qt-designer.

.. warning:: In qt-designer, one must set 'vertical layout' on the top widget
   (right click on the top widget > Lay out > Vertical layout).

You can configure the path to a ``file://`` or ``http://``. The check box is for
activated this ui. The qt file is an xml file.

Here an example of a small form develop with qt-designer.

On the second part of the tab, you can configure the fields to appear on the sheet. Each field is represented by the following parameters :

 * Field title : name of your line used as label on the sheet.
 * Field type : define the type of field displayed on the sheet. Supported field types :

   * title : to create a title on your sheet
   * text : show a text
   * url : a simple url link, open your default browser.
   * urlx : an url button
   * picture : show a picture from an internal user in your sheet, you need to use {xivo-picture} variable.
   * phone : create a tel: link, you can click to call on your sheet.
   * form : show the form from an ui predefined. It's an xml ui. You need to define qtui in display format.

 * Default value : is to define a text when the fourth field have no result.
 * Display value : you can define text, variables or both. Three kinds of variables are available :

   * `xivo-` prefix is reserved and set inside the CTI server:

     * `xivo-where` for sheet events, event triggering the sheet
     * `xivo-origin` place from where the lookup is requested (did, internal, forcelookup)
     * `xivo-direction` incoming or internal
     * `xivo-did` DID number
     * `xivo-calleridnum`
     * `xivo-calleridname`
     * `xivo-calleridrdnis` contains information whether there was a transfer
     * `xivo-calleridton` Type Of Network (national, international)
     * `xivo-calledidnum`
     * `xivo-calledidname`
     * `xivo-context`
     * `xivo-ipbxid` (`xivo-astid` in 1.1)
     * `xivo-directory` : for directory requests, it is the directory database the item has been found
     * `xivo-queuename` queue called
     * `xivo-agentnumber` agent number called
     * `xivo-date` formatted date string
     * `xivo-time` formatted time string
     * `xivo-channel` asterisk channel value (for advanced users)
     * `xivo-uniqueid` asterisk uniqueid value (for advanced users)

   * `db-` prefixed variables are defined in the WEBI configuration, and depend on the matching list. Common values are :

     * `db-phone`
     * `db-firstname`
     * `db-lastname`
     * `db-company`

   * `dbr-` contains one single item `dbr-display` that is used in the setting
     of what is displayed on phones, and is typically a mix of firstname and
     lastname
   * `dp-` prefixed ones are the variables set through the dialplan (through
     UserEvent application)

For example if you want to access from the dialplan to a variable dp-test you
need to add in your dialplan this line (in a subroutine)::

   UserEvent(dialplan2cti,UNIQUEID: ${UNIQUEID},CHANNEL: ${CHANNEL},VARIABLE: test,VALUE: "Salut")

The ``{dp-test}`` displays Salut.

.. warning:: fields of type 'form' work differently from other field
   types. Fields `Field title` and `Default value` are not used and
   field `Display value` MUST be set to ``qtui``.

Systray
=======

Mostly the same syntax as the sheet with less field types available (title,
body). A Systray popup will display a single title (the last one added to the
list of fields) and zero, one or more fields of type 'body'.

.. figure:: images/sheets_configuration_systray.png
   :scale: 85%


Actions
=======

The action is for the xivo client, so if you configure an action, please do sure
you understand it's executed by the client. You need to allow this action in
the client configuration too.

The field in this tab receives the URL that will be displayed in your
browser. You can use the same variable like {xivo-callerid}.

 * `http://x.y.z.co.fr/anything` opens the URL on the default browser
 * `tcp://x.y.z.co.fr:4545/?var1=a1&var2=a2&var3=v3` connects to TCP port 4545
   on x.y.z.co.fr, sends the string `var1=a1&var2=a2&var3=v3`, then closes
 * `udp://x.y.z.co.fr:4545/?var1=a1&var2=a2&var3=v3` connects to UDP port 4545
   on x.y.z.co.fr, sends the string `var1=a1&var2=a2&var3=v3`, then closes

.. note:: any string that would not be understood as an URL will be handled like and URL
   it is a process to launch and will be executed as it is written

For `tcp://` and `udp://`, it is a requirement that the string between `/` and `?` is empty.
An extension could be to define other serialization methods, if needed.

Event configuration
===================

You can configure a sheet when a specific event is called. For example if you want to received a sheet when an agent answer to a call, you can choose a sheet model for the Agent link event.

The followed event possible is :

 * Dial: When you received a call (the user phone ringing)
 * Link: When you answer a call
 * Unlink: When the call is unlink
 * Agent linked: When an agent answer to a call
 * Agent unlinked: When an agent hangup the call
 * Incoming DID: Received a call in a DID
 * Outgoing Call: Made an outgoing call
 * Hangup: Hangup the call
 * Incoming Queue: Received a call in a queue
 * Incoming Group: Received a call in a group
 * Fax reception: Received a fax

.. warning:: The link event will not work if an agent is used. Use Link for user members of a queue and agent linked for agents.

Dialplan interaction
====================

UserEvent for a custom event. You need to configure by web interface the custom event::

   UserEvent(Custom,NAME: myevent,UNIQUEID: ${UNIQUEID},CHANNEL: ${CHANNEL})
