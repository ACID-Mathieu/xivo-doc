Dial Xlet

Overview
========

The Dial Xlet allows you to make calls from your computer, via your phone. This
means that you can enter the number that you want to dial on your computer, then
your phone rings and when you answer it, the called phone will ring.

Usage
=====

You can enter the number you want to dial in the text box and then click the
button or press enter to dial it.

If you dial an invalid extension (a number is an extension), your phone will
ring and you will be told that the extension is not valid.

The numbers you dialed are stored in the drop-down list of the text box.


Configuration
=============

In the menu :menuselection:`XiVO Client --> Configure --> Functions --> Dial`,
you can choose how much dialed extensions will be saved between two connections.

In the menu :menuselection:`XiVO Client --> Configure --> GUI Settings`, you can
enable the integration of the clipboard in the XiVO Client : all text selected
in other programs will be automatically pasted in the Dial text box. This
feature currently only works on GNU/Linux systems.
