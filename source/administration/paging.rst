Paging
******

With XiVO, you can define paging (i.e. intercom) extensions to page a
group of users. When calling a paging extension, the user's phones will
auto-answer if they support it.

You can manage your paging extensions via the :menuselection:`Services --> IPBX --> Paging`
page. When adding a new paging extension, the number can be anything; to call it,
you just need to prefix the paging number with ``*11``.
